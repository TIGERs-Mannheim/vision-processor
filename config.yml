  # Camera exposure time in ms to adjust brightness. Higher values lead to more motion blur. Lower values lead to a darker image.
  # Camera frame rate will drop if set equal to or higher than the frame time (1 / fps_cam).
  # 0.0 = automatic exposure

  # Camera gain to adjust brightness. Higher values lead to more noise. Lower values lead to a darker image.
  # 0.0 = automatic gain

  # Camera gamma as nonlinear brightness adjustment. Only supported on SPINNAKER and OPENCV.
  # Low values reduce differences between bright and dark illuminated areas. High values increase the color contrast.
  # 1.0 = no gamma

  # Camera white balance. OUTDOOR or INDOOR for auto white balance with green or gray carpet respectively.
